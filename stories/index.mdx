# Definition

Tooltip is a floating interactive element that appears when hovering over or focusing on content.

You can place text, HTML elements, and interactive components inside of a tooltip.

Tooltips are often used for providing additional context, help text, or detailed information about UI elements.

## Usage

The component comes in different configurations such as `placement`, `arrow`, `offset`, and `interactive` which you can use to alter the look, position and behavior of the tooltip.

> **Note:** The tooltip is headless by default, meaning it has no built-in styles. The styles shown in the later stories are just for demonstration purposes. You can customize the appearance using your own CSS classes or utility classes like Tailwind CSS.

```jsx
import Tooltip from 'headless-tooltip';

function Example() {
  return (
    <Tooltip
      content={<span>This is a tooltip message</span>}
      placement="bottom"
      arrow
      className="max-w-80 rounded-lg bg-gray-900 px-3 py-2 text-xs font-normal text-white"
    >
      <button>Hover me</button>
    </Tooltip>
  );
}
```
